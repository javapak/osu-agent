# deepsu!

<h2>.osu + .osr dataset utility</h2>
<p>
deepsu! will be an agent that generates human like replays for the online rhythym game osu! given a respective .osu (beatmap) file. This project is for COMP 4720-001 at the University of Memphis. As it stands, we are currently in the process of creating a utility for dataset generation by parsing beatmaps (.osu) and replay files (.osr) and storing them locally for training data. At this current time, that is all that will be living in this repository. This project was inspired by https://github.com/GuiBrandt/OsuLearn
